# NBA Scheduling via Linear Programming (MATLAB and a little Python)
We attempt to solve the sports scheduling problem using Linear Integer Programming. Code is implemented in Matlab and uses built in functionality and libraries.

### Results
We were able to find a feasible schedule. Further implementations will focus on making schedule "realistic"
